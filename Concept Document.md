# Concept Document
For our class project, we have decided to make a Personal Expense Tracker (PET). The concept of this practiacl project occurred due to a lack of time -- both myself(Ryan) and Antoine are busy students both taking over 15 credits this semester, commute to campus, as well as commit significant time to internships. Because of this, we find ourselves with a lack of time for some of the necessites in life, like managing our money. 

We want a quick and easy way to be able to put in how much we expect to spend this week, given our pay for the month, on certain items. The program should have some mandatory fields like 'Rent' that we have to pay, whereas some fields like 'Shopping' may have to be decreased in order to break-even for that given week. We want a program that allows us to input our income on a monthly basis, then we have the options to put in our expenses for the given week. Using this information, the program will generate a report which encourages/discourages certain spending for the week.

The reason that this program will be useful for us is because we can spend less time worrying about 'If I buy this expensive dinner, am I going to be able to afford gas tomorrow?'. We want to be able to spend all our brain power thinking of programming or Hoare Logic, but we are often drained out by the monotinies of life. 

This document shows what our project will be and why we are programming it. We will be doing so in the language Julia to expand our knowledge on Programming Languages. Julia will be advantageous in this program because it excels in speed for mathematical programs, and in this program, we will use some algorithms to figure out what our spending should look like.
