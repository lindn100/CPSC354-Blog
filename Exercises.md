For our blog posts about the blog exercises, please refer to [Blog 3](https://github.com/lindn100/CPSC354-Blog/blob/master/Blog%203%20-%20Diving.md), [Blog 5](https://github.com/lindn100/CPSC354-Blog/blob/master/Blog%205%20-%20Measure%20Functions.md), and [Blog 7](https://github.com/lindn100/CPSC354-Blog/blob/master/Blog%207%20-%20Preconditions%2C%20Postconditions%2C%20and%20Invariants.md).

Blog 3 specifically addresses the first blog post, about Term Rewriting Systems. Here we took a simple algorithm and explained why it terminates and its reduction steps.

Blog 5 dives into more detail by creating a recursive algorithm and explaining the termination behind it.

Blog 7 finally looks at partial correctness of a while loop.

For all other exercises, we have done them on paper and are attending office hours for our additional questions on them.

Thank you!
