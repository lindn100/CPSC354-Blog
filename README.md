# CPSC354-Blog
Hello. Our names are Ryan Lindner and Antoine Canaan. For our class project, we will be developing a personal financial tracker in the programming language Julia. This project will help us both to learn a new programming language and its strengths, as well as be a practical application which will help us both in our daily lives, as we are very busy college students.

## Tentative Dates for our Project

* Concept Stage: Finalize on what we want to create as a concept, produce a report in detail as to what we want to develop. DUE DATE: 10/19 (COMPLETED: 10/18)
* Definition Stage: Begin defining what we will need in our development stage. Develop a model on how we want the program to flow. Should involve drawings and pre-planning of how the program should work. DUE DATE: 10/29
* Development Stage: Code the program. Use the materials in the definition stage to serve as a pathway to what we need to develop. This stage should result in twice a week meetrings to report on progress, whether it be a 5 minute meeting or a 1 hr meeting. Short snippets of code will be given to both Ryan and Antoine. DUE DATE: 11/28
* Testing Stage: Test the program extensively and resolve/document any outstanding bugs. DUE DATE: 12/7
