# Goodbye Julia!

We have finally been able to put together a prototype of our Personal Expense Tracker. Our PET allows the user to either start a brand new report and enter in information, or load in the previous week's report and edit information. After doing this, our program creates advice on how to better manage your expenses.

That being said, there are still some outstanding bugs. For example, after entering in new or previous report, there is a long load time, and we aren't sure why this happens. There are some other bugs too, but this prototype is what we were able to accomplish, with our limited knowledge of Julia.

Overall, we have mixed feelings about Julia. We liked the speed that Julia offered, as well as its easy-to-read syntax. However, we also had our gripes, as debugging the project was a huge pain for us as we had to find our errors at runtime. In addition,we had several issues regarding scope of variables, which we ended up scrapping and just creating a brand new set of variables for. In addition, it was not geared towards being OOP, which both Antoine and I are accustomed to, so we were a bit out of our element.

We would recommend Julia to someone looking for a very fast language, implementing a program with a well-defined set of functions. However, we currently do not recommend using Julia for large-scale programs with debugging needs, as its debugging is so lacking at the moment.

A lot has been learned on our journey with Julia, and we both feel like we came out of this experience as better programmers with a deeper understanding of Programming Languages as a whole.

For further information on how to run our Julia program, please see our post on [Installing Julia](https://github.com/lindn100/CPSC354-Blog/blob/master/Installing%20Julia.md).
**I'm afraid that is all we have. Special thanks goes to Prof. Kurz for allowing us to explore a language we had not heard of before this semester, as well as our peers who followed along with our blog and gave us advice/suggestions. Thank you all for all your help. Have a great day!**
