#Hello Julia!#
Hello! My name is Ryan Lindner and I am a student at Chapman University. I'm a senior but I will be graduating in Dec of 2019 instead of May.
I will choose to work alone for Programming Languages and I am choosing to pursue the language Julia. Personally, I have not followed
very many blogs at all, but after some quick research, I admire [Lambda the Ultimate - The Programming Language Weblog] (http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/).

##How I Heard about Julia##
After attending the first class, I felt a bit overwhelmed. I had never been given the freedom to choose whatever language I wanted to pursue.
I have also never been given the freedom to create whatever software I want. So I turned to my friends for advice.

I have a friend named Brian who is now a developer working at Kaiser Permanente. When I frantically asked him for advice, he told me of a 
relatively new language called Julia which was rising in popularity. I was intrigued at first because of its name, but the more I looked
into it, the more I liked it.

###What I Expect about Julia###

From my initial research, I've found that Julia is a dynamically typed language created in 2012. However, Julia also claims that it
has the speed of compiled languages like C/C++. A concept core to [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is that it is a multiple dispatch language.
I will gladly dive into that next blog! In addition, Julia's speed is great for numerical computing. Because of this, here is a list
of some potential software developments I have:

*Some sort of game
*Expense Tracker + Report Production
*Budget Analysis
*Linear Algebra Calculator 

And many more to come. Linear Algebra is fresh in my mind from last semester, and both of the financial type softwares could easily help
me plan for my current and future financials. Finally, games are always fun and I've never had a chance to try my hand at it.

**For now, I'm super excited to start the semester and learn tons about Julia!**
